Nextech Coding Challenge

Using the Hacker News API, create a solution that allows users to view the newest stories from the feed.
 
Your solution must be developed using an Angular front-end app that calls a C# .NET Core back-end restful API.
 
The front-end UI should consist of:
* A list of the newest stories
* Each list item should include the title and a link to the news article. Watch out for stories that do not have hyperlinks!
* A search feature that allows users to find stories
* A paging mechanism. While we love reading, 200 stories on the page is a bit much.
* Automated tests for your code
 
The back-end API should consist of:
* Usage of dependency injection, it's built-in so why not?
* Caching of the newest stories
* Automated tests for your code
